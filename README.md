# CrazyfliePLS
Pioneer Library System's Python wrapper for the Crazyflie 2.0

To use this setup for a class, first install Python 2.7 in its default install
location (C:\Python27). Then run the PythonUSB.bat batch script provided to install
the necessary Python library to talk to the CrazyRadioPA. Download the Python controller
code from the Crazyflie site and copy its lib folder to the same location as the 
CrazyfliePLS.py.
